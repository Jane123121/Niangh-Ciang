  <h1>My Hobby:<span class="underline">Watching Movies</span></h1>

<p> Watching movies is one of my favourite hobbies. I enjoy watching movies because they help me relax and escape from daily stress. <br> Movies also allow me to experience different cultures, stories, and emotions. Whether it is a comedy, romance, horror or action film, <br> each movie offers a unique experience and teaches something new. </p>

I usually watch movies during my free time or on weekends. Sometimes I watch
movies alone, and sometimes I watch them with friends or family. <br> Watching
movies together is enjoyable because we can share opinions and discuss the <br> 
story. Movies also improve my Englishlistening skills and help me understand
different accents.

<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
<ol class = "favmovie">
  <li>The Pursuit of Happyness
    <div class="movie-description">

      <p>
        I like *The Pursuit of Happyness* very much because it is extremely inspirational. It stars Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith. 
      It tells the true story of Chris Gardner, who overcomes homelessness and many challenges 
      to achieve his dreams. The movie teaches lessons about perseverance, hope, and never giving up.

      <p>
        One of my favourite romantic films is One Day (Thailand). It tells the story of Denchai, a shy IT professional, and Nui, his colleague. Denchai has secretly admired Nui for a long time but is too shy to express his feelings. During an office trip, he finally gets the chance to spend one special day with her. The film beautifully captures their growing connection. The cinematography is stunning, and the scenery in Japan is breathtaking. I love this movie because it is heartfelt, relatable, and full of tender moments. The story also teaches the importance of taking chances in love, appreciating small moments, and being honest about your feelings.

  <li>Ready or Not

       Ready or Not stars Samara Weaving as Grace, a bride who, on her wedding night, is forced to take part in a bizarre family ritual with her wealthy new in‑laws. What should be a happy start to married life turns into a terrifying game of hide‑and-seek, where Grace must survive the night while being hunted through the family’s mansion. The movie mixes suspense, dark humour, and clever twists that keep you on edge, and I love it because of its fun energy, strong lead performance, and Grace as a final girl.
